  This templates repository replaces that original project and is now the canonical template for Sphinx-based technotes.

- Added the `templatekit.yaml` configuration.

- Adopted the full text of the CC-BY license so that GitHub's licensee can detect the license for our technotes.

- Adopted the project-standard [COPYRIGHT file](https://developer.lsst.io/legal/copyright-overview.html).

- Switched to [LTD Conveyor](https://ltd-conveyor.lsst.io) as the upload client for LSST the Docs.
  [LTD Mason](https://ltd-mason.lsst.io) is deprecated.
