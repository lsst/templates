 abstract = "{The Large-aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) represents the next
              generation of wide-field survey telescopes. With repeated scans of the sky on
              timescales ranging from a few minutes to several years it will be one of the
              first of the wide-area survey facilities to open up the study of the time domain
              in astrophysics. The scientific returns from such an approach are numerous,
              ranging from the dynamics of near-Earth asteroids and Kuiper-belt objects
              through to the detection of intermediate and high redshift supernovae. We will
              discuss here the impact that such a diverse range of sci- entific questions will
              have on the analysis and management of the data flow from such a telescope. We
              will focus on a number of areas that must be addressed in order for the
              successful operation of the LSST. These will include: a) the computational
              challenge presented by a data rate in excess of 300GB per hour b) the impact of
              the optical design on the photometric accuracy and image quality of the system
              together with how this translates into implementing efficient techniques for
              measuring the differ- ences between repeated observations or for co-adding
              multiple images to construct a deep image of the sky c) the impact on the design
              of the software due to the require- ment that we be able to detect variability
              over a very broad range of temporal scales (from almost real-time though to
              several years). Throughout we will discuss the cur- rent state-of-the-art in
              analysis software and algorithms and how they might be expected to scale with
              the increase in computational resources over the coming decade. We will then
              identify which computational data management challenges we must address in the
              near future.}",

                  enormously in size and complexity in recent
                  years. The largest transactional databases and data
                  warehouses can no longer be hosted cost-effectively
                  in off-the-shelf commercial database management
                  systems. There are other forums for discussing
                  databases and data warehouses, but they typically
                  deal with problems occurring at smaller scales and
                  do not always focus on practical solutions or
                  influencing DBMS vendors. Given the relatively small
                  (but highly influential and growing) number of users
                  with these databases and the relatively small number
                  of opportunities to exchange practical information
                  related to DBMSes at extremely large scale, a
                  workshop on extremely large databases was

                  communities was organized in response to suggestions
                  at the first XLDB Workshop. The goal was to develop
                  common requirements and primitives for a
                  next-generation database management system that
                  scientists would use, including those from
                  high-energy physics, astronomy, biology, geoscience
                  and fusion, in order to stimulate research and
                  advance technology. These requirements were thought
                  by the database researchers to be novel and unlikely
                  to be fully met by current commercial vendors. The
                  two groups accordingly decided to explore building a
                  new open source DBMS. This paper is the final report
                  of the discussions and activities at the workshop.},

                  base users from astronomy, particle physics, fusion,
                  remote sensing, oceanography, and biology. The
                  intent has been to specify a common set of
                  requirements for a new science data base system,
                  which we call SciDB. In addition, we have discovered
                  that very complex business analytics share most of
                  the same requirements as "big science". We have also
                  constructed a partnership of companies to fund the
                  development of SciDB, including eBay, the Large
                  Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), Microsoft, the
                  Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
                  Vertica. Lastly, we have identified two "lighthouse
                  customers" (LSST and eBay) who will run the initial
                  system, once it is constructed. In this paper, we
                  report on the requirements we have identified and
                  briefly sketch some of the SciDB design.},

                  facing the challenge of petabytes of data, but
                  managing and analyzing such large data sets still
                  remains a daunting task. Both the database and the
                  map/reduce communities worldwide are working on
                  addressing these issues. The 3rd Extremely Large
                  Databases workshop was organized to examine the
                  needs of scientific communities beginning to face
                  these issues, to reach out to European communities
                  working on extremely large scale data challenges,
                  and to brainstorm possible solutions. The science
                  benchmark that emerged from the 2nd workshop in this
                  series was also debated. This paper is the final
                  report of the discussions and activities at this
                  workshop.}

                  http://lsst.org) is a planned, large-aperture,
                  wide-field, ground-based telescope that will survey
                  half the sky every few nights in six optical bands
                  from 320 to 1050 nm. It will explore a wide range of
                  astrophysical questions, ranging from discovering
                  'killer' asteroids, to examining the nature of dark
                  energy.  LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes
                  of data per night, yielding a reduced data set of
                  over 100 petabytes at the end of its 10-year
                  mission. Dedicated HPC facilities (at NCSA) will
                  process the images in near real time, with
                  full-dataset reprocessing occurring on annual
                  scale. A sophisticated data management system (DMS)
                  will enable database queries from individual users,
                  as well as computationally intensive scientific
                  investigations that utilize the entire data set.
                  LSST will be the first optical survey delivering
                  petabyte-sized catalogs. Creating and mining those
                  catalogs presents the community with significant
                  challenges, as well as opportunities. In this
                  colloquium I will present the science expected from
                  LSST, the technology needed to achieve it, and
                  provide an update of project status.}

  abstract =     {The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST;
                  http://lsst.org) is a planned, large-aperture,
                  widefield, ground-based telescope that will survey
                  half the sky every few nights in six optical bands
                  from 320 to 1050 nm. It will explore a wide range of
                  astrophysical questions, ranging from discovering
                  killer asteroids, to examining the nature of dark
                  energy. LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of
                  data per night, yielding an (uncompressed) reduced
                  data set of 200 petabytes at the end of its 10-year
                  mission. Dedicated HPC facilities (with a total of
                  320 TFLOPS at start, scaling up to 1.7 PFLOPS by the
                  end) will process the image data in near real time,
                  with full-dataset reprocessings occurring on annual
                  scale. A sophisticated data management system (DMS)
                  will enable database queries from individual users,
                  as well as computationally intensive scientific
                  investigations that utilize the entire data set. The
                  nature, quality, and volume of LSST data will be
                  unprecedented in optical/IR astronomy, so the DMS
                  design features petascale storage, terascale
                  computing, and gigascale communications. LSST will
                  be the first optical survey delivering
                  petabyte-sized catalogs. Creating and mining those
                  catalogs presents the community with significant
                  challenges, as well as opportunities. I will discuss
                  the DM system, the data products needed to achieve
                  LSST’s science goals, the algorithms and technology
                  being put in place to generate them, and report on
                  DM’s progress as we prepare for Construction.},

                  scientific investigations in multi-dimensional space

                  pixels into catalogs, on simulated images and
                  existing time domain surveys. A 250
                  sq. deg. repeatedly-imaged stripe of the SDSS called
                  Stripe 82 provides a strong test dataset because it
                  was obtained under skies with highly variable
                  conditions. Reprocessing the 20TB of imaging
                  consisted of detecting sources on i-band co-adds but
                  measuring flux on the single-epoch (ugriz) images,
                  generating complete and less biased lightcurves for
                  sources fainter than the single-epoch detection
                  threshold. I will describe the technical challenges
                  of aggregating these 16 billion photometry
                  measurements into lightcurve metrics for each of the
                  40 million objects. I will also discuss our
                  application of ensemble classifiers to this dataset
                  to select z~4 quasars with care to maintain the
                  ability to estimate the completeness of the sample
                  when the underlying population has a complex

                  Telescope (LSST) is starting this year. Its large

                  range of astrophysical questions, ranging from
                  discovering “killer” asteroids, to examining the
                  nature of dark energy. The exploration will involve
                  running a wide range of spatial and temporal
                  analyses, including computationally intensive
                  scientific investigations in multi-dimensional space
                  over the entire data set. Over a million analyses,
                  from trivial to very complex, are expected daily,
                  every day, for decades. A specialized database
                  system is developed to make that not only possible,
                  but also fast and efficient. The talk will describe
                  the driving requirements, assumptions made, and
                  design trade offs that were considered in developing
                  the baseline architecture for the LSST

                  Qserv, will be given, highlighting its features,
                  status, and potential for usage outside LSST and
