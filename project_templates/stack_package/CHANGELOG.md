# Change log

## 2020-01-07

- Rename the "Contributing" section of the module homepage to "Design and development."
  This section can be used more broadly to contain documentation oriented to internal developers.
  Pages linked from this section should be contained in a subdirectory named `dev`.

[DM-21228](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-21228)

## 2020-01-06

- Add a "Pipeline tasks" section to the module homepage template.

[DM-22520](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-22520)

## 2019-11-07

Added support for the [lsst-sitcom](https://github.com/lsst-sitcom) GitHub organization.

## 2019-11-05

Updated the AURA copyright to "Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA)."

## 2019-11-04

Added a new `uses_dds` Cookiecutter variable.
When enabled, this variable adds a block to the `tests/SConscript` file that adds the contents of the  `OSPL_URI`, `OPENSPLICE_LOC`, and `ADLINK_LICENSE` environment variables to the PATH of the SCons environment.
These are necessary for T&S packages that work with OpenSplice DDS (the base technology used by SAL).

Slack-based users can trigger this variable by selecting a "DDS Package" item from the flavor menu.

## 2019-10-10

Packages that don't use C++ are now one file simpler:

- No `ups/*.cfg` file for non-C++ packages.
- The `SConstruct` file for non-C++ packages includes the `noCfgFile=True` argument.

[DM-21718](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-21718)

## 2019-09-20

- Added support for the https://github.com/lsst/lsst-verification-and-validation GitHub organization.

[DM-21376](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-21376)

## 2019-07-30

- Added a "Script reference" section to link to script topic pages (see [script_topic](../../file_templates/script_topic) and [argparse_script_topic](../../file_templates/argparse_script_topic)).

[DM-20821](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-20821)

## 2019-01-15

- Added a new template variable, `cookiecutter.stack_name`.
  This identifies what "stack" the package is part of, if at all.
  The current default is "LSST Science Pipelines," whose packages have documentation published at https://pipelines.lsst.io.
  If `cookiecutter.stack_name` is set to "None" then the package is considered to stand alone.
  In that case, the `doc/` directory is rearranged to support a standalone documentation site for the package.

- Added an `example_standalone/` package that demonstrates `cookiecutter.stack_name=="None"` and `cookiecutter.base_package=="sconsUtils"`.
  This example should be close to a typical Telescope & Site package starting point.

- Fixed an issue with the `cookiecutter.base_package` variable (the `sconsUtils` option was misspelled as `setupUtils`).

[DM-17191](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-17191)

## 2019-01-11

- Eliminated intermediate `__init__.py` files.
  In Python 3, `__init__.py` files are no longer needed to establish a package.
  This also means that the `pkgutil.extend_path` method call is no longer needed.
  Nor is the lsstimport package from the "base" EUPS package.

  The template still keeps the `__init__.py` of the module itself; this file is still commonly used for establishing public namespaces so it's good to keep it in the template.

- Added a new cookiecutter variable, `cookiecutter.base_package`.
  This selects the default package.
  Science Pipelines packages should use `base` as the base package (the effective outcome of [RFC-52](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/RFC-52)), while other stacks that don't need `base` can use `sconsUtils`.

- Removed the `utils` package as a default dependency, reversing the change from 2018-11-05.
  Developers should add the `utils` dependency if their code uses it (for example, in tests).

[DM-17155](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-17155)

## 2018-11-05

- Added `bin/` and `.coverage` to `.gitignore`.
- Added `base` as a default EUPS dependency.
  This prevents packages that have not other dependencies from having errors about getting `lsstimport`.
  Packages that add high-level dependencies can drop the explicit dependency on `base`.
- Also add `utils` as a default EUPS dependency since it is necessary for unit tests, in most cases.
- Marked W504 (line break after binary operator) as an ignored Flake8 rule.
  This rule was introduced by pycodestyle 2.4.0, but is not part of the [DM Python Style Guide](https://developer.lsst.io/python/style.html).
  See the post [Changes to baseline software versions](https://community.lsst.org/t/changes-to-baseline-software-versions/3366).

[DM-16437](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-16437)

## 2018-10-10

- New "Task reference" section in the module homepages.
  The `has_tasks` configuration controls whether the "Task reference" section is included or not.

[DM-15422](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15422)

## 2018-10-05

- `doc/SConscript` and `doc/doxygen.conf.in` are no longer included in packages that don't use C++.
- `conf.py` does not attempt to import a package if it doesn't not use Python.
- The package homepage no longer refers to the (nonexistent) Python module.
- The E251 rule exception is no longer included in `setup.cfg` since it is also not adopted by the [Python style guide](https://developer.lsst.io/python/style.html#exceptions-to-pep-8).

([DM-15973](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15973), [DM-16040](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-16040))

## 2018-07-13

- Deleted the `ups/*.build` file.
  It turns out that this file is not used by the build system.

- Added `pyList` argument to the `tests/Sconscript` file.
  This enables auto file detection.

- Updated the `setup.cfg` configuration file.
  This adds the N806 flake8 exception and the `[tool:pytest]` section.

- Updated the default `automodapi` usage in module documentation homepages.

  - `no-main-docstr` is something we always want to use since the main docstring in `__init__.py` shouldn't be used, in favour of writing topics in the `doc/` directory.

  - Most modules don't have interesting class inheritance, so it makes sense to default to `no-inheritance-diagram`.

([DM-15110](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15110))

## 2018-07-06

- Add a `uses_python` configuration in `cookiecutter.json`.
  When both `uses_python` and `uses_cpp` are `False`, the package is data-only (like `afwdata` or `verify_metrics`, for example).
  See the `example_dataonly` example package.

- The package homepage (`doc/{{cookiecutter.package_name}}/index.rst`) now only appears for data-only packages.
  Similarly, the module homepage (`doc/{{cookiecutter.python_module}}/index.rst`) now only appears for packages that provide a Python module.

- Redesigned the package and module homepages to both have a Contributing section (replacing the project info section formerly in the package homepage).
  The contributing section links to the GitHub repository and Jira component.
  This section can be expanded with a toctree to link to topics about how to develop the module or package itself.
  The template also includes a commented-out "Using" section that provides a toctree for linking to topics related to using the package or module.

- The `statics` field in `doc/manifest.yaml` is now commented out by default.
  Most packages don't need a static content directory.

([DM-15024](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15024))

## 2018-06-21

- Add `disableCc=True` argument to the `SConstruct` for Python-only packages.
  ([DM-14860](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-14860))

## 2018-06-04

- Remove version pinning from `ups/{{package_name}}.table`.
  Version pinning isn't used anymore since all packages are tagged together.
  ([DM-14668](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-14668))
