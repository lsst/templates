# technote_latex

**LSST technical note repository, formatted as LaTeX (lsstdoc class).**

This template generates a new technical note (technote) repository based on LaTeX (specifically the `lsstdoc` class).
LSST technotes, in general, let you document technical designs, proposals, product overviews, results of prototyping experiments, and other types of documentation that doesn't fit in either the change-controlled document tree, or in user documentation.
See [Technotes for stand-alone technical documentation in the Developer Guide](https://developer.lsst.io/project-docs/technotes.html).

## Template variables

### cookiecutter.org

The organization responsible for the document.
This is used as an argument for the `lsstdoc` class.

### cookiecutter.series

The identifier of the technote series.
Choose the series that fits the document's purpose or aligns with the organization creating the document:

- `DMTN` for Data Management technical notes. See [DMTN-000](https://dmtn-000.lsst.io).
- `ITTN` for LSST IT technical notes.
- `RTN` for Rubin Observatory operations technical notes (all departments).
- `PSTN` for Project Science Team technical notes.
- `SMTN` for Simulations Group technical notes. See [SMTN-000](https://smtn-000.lsst.io).
- `SITCOMTN` for Systems Integration, Testing, and Commissioning notes.
- `SQR` for SQuaRE technical notes. See [SQR-000](https://sqr-000.lsst.io).
- `TSTN` for Telescope & Site technical notes.
- `TESTN` for testing the technical system. *These notes may be purged at any time.*

### cookiecutter.serial_number

The serial number. Use three digits padded with zeros.
If you are creating a technical note manually with this template, see the [Create a technote](https://developer.lsst.io/project-docs/technotes.html#create-a-technote) instructions for how to determine the serial number.

### cookiecutter.github_org

The GitHub organization where this technote resides.
Choose a GitHub organization that matches the [series](#cookiecutter_series):

- `lsst-dm` for the DMTN series.
- `lsst-it` for the ITTN series.
- `lsst` for the RTN series.
- `lsst-pst` for the PSTN series.
- `lsst-sims` for the Simulations Group's SMTN series.
- `lsst-sitcom` for the SITCOMTN series.
- `lsst-sqre` for the SQuaRE SQR series.
- `lsst-sqre-testing` for the TESTN series.
- `lsst-tstn` for the TSTN series.

### cookiecutter.title

The title of the technote.

### cookiecutter.first_author

The name of the first author, formatted as `First Last`.
Additional authors can be added later in the LaTeX source itself.

### cookiecutter.abstract

A short description of the technote's content and purpose.
This description is used in the repository's README and the abstract in the document itself.

### cookiecutter.copyright_year

The year of the initial copyright claim.
Cookiecutter will automatically populate the current year.

### cookiecutter.copyright_holder

The initial copyright holder.
See [Copyrights for LSST DM work and the COPYRIGHT file](https://developer.lsst.io/legal/copyright-overview.html) for more information.

## Examples

### testn-000/

The [testn-000](testn-000) directory is an example of a LaTeX-formatted technote.

## Files

## .gitignore

Example: [.gitignore](testn-000/.gitignore).

The gitignore file ignores the built PDF product (which is persisted on LSST the Docs), as well as intermediate LaTeX build files (including `meta.tex`).
The `acronyms.tex` file is not ignored so that `make acronyms.tex` does not need to be run for every document build.

## .github/workflows/ci.yaml

Example: [.github/workflows/ci.yaml](testn-000/.github/workflows/ci.yaml).

The GitHub Actions workflow file.
You shouldn't have to modify this file unless you have a novel preprocessing build step (see below).

**Tip:** GitHub Actions provides a flexible Python environment.
It's likely easier to run preprocessing scripts directly from the GitHub actions environment, rather than within the lsst-texmf Docker container:

- Install additional Python dependencies in the `Python install` step.
- Add additional bash commands for preprocessing steps to run before the `docker run` step.
- Structure your `Makefile` so that files built in advance in the GitHub actions environment are automatically used as-is by the `docker run` command.

For more information about using the CI environment, see the [GitHub actions workflow documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

## acronyms.tex

Example: [acronyms.tex](testn-000/acronyms.tex).

This file is generated and updated by the `make acronyms.tex` command.

### COPYRIGHT

Example: [COPYRIGHT](testn-000/COPYRIGHT).

Record copyright claims in this file, one line per institution.
See the [copyright](../copyright) template and [Copyrights for LSST DM work and the COPYRIGHT file](https://developer.lsst.io/legal/copyright-overview.html).

### LICENSE

Example: [LICENSE](testn-000/LICENSE).

Generally speaking, LSST documentation is licensed under CC-BY 4.0.
See [Licensing LSST DM source code and content](https://developer.lsst.io/legal/licensing-overview.html) in the Developer Guide for more information.

### local.bib

Example: [local.bib](testn-000/local.bib).

Add BibTeX citations to this file that aren't already available in [lsst-texmf](https://lsst-texmf.lsst.io) (the [lsstbib/](#testn-000/local_bib).
See the [Updating bibliographies](https://lsst-texmf.lsst.io/developer.html#updating-bibliographies) documentation in lsst-texmf for how to migrate local bibliography data upstream into [lsst-texmf](https://lsst-texmf.lsst.io).

### Makefile

Example: [Makefile](testn-000/Makefile).

The built-in targets are:

- `make`: compiles the PDF document by running `xelatex` and `bibtex` iteratively.
  This command is used by the CI environment that pushes the PDF to LSST the Docs (lsst.io).
  See the [.travis.yml](#travisyml) file.
- `make acronyms.tex`: regenerates the [acronyms.tex](#acronymstex) file.

Add additional make targets to do preprocessing steps (such as running a Python script to generate tables or figures).

### myacronyms.txt

Example: [Makefile](testn-000/Makefile).

List acronyms in this file that are not found in lsst-texmf's [lsstacronyms.txt](https://github.com/lsst/lsst-texmf/blob/master/etc/lsstacronyms.txt) or [glossary.txt](https://github.com/lsst/lsst-texmf/blob/master/etc/glossary.txt), or that have multiple definitions (put the one you want in the local `myacronyms.txt` file).

The format for each line of this file is:

```
ACRONYM:Definition
```

For example:

```
MIA:Missing In Action
```

### README.rst

Example: [README.rst](testn-000/README.rst).

The README advertises the technote to GitHub visitors and provides instructions for authors.

You can update the abstract in the README and add author instructions as necessary.

### skipacronyms.txt

Example: [skipacronyms.txt](testn-000/skipacronyms.txt).

This file contains a list acronyms that should be ignored by `generateAcronyms.py` (the script behind `make acronyms.txt`).
If your document contains acronym-like strings that aren't acronyms, you can add them to `skipacronyms.txt`.

### {{cookiecutter.series.upper()}}-{{cookiecutter.serial_number}}.tex

Example: [TESTN-000.tex](testn-000/TESTN-000.tex)

This file contains the content of the technote itself.
Either write directly in this file, or use the `\input` command to include content from other files.
