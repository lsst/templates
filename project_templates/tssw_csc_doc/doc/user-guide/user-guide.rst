  This is a template for the user-guide documentation that will accompany each CSC.
  This template is provided to ensure that the documentation remains similar in look, feel, and contents to users.
  The headings below are expected to be present for all CSCs, but for many CSCs, additional fields will be required.

  ** All text in square brackets [] must be re-populated accordingly **

  See https://developer.lsst.io/restructuredtext/style.html
  for a guide to reStructuredText writing.

  Use the following syntax for sections:

  Sections
  ========

  and

  Subsections
  -----------

  and

  Subsubsections
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  To add images, add the image file (png, svg or jpeg preferred) to the
  images/ directory. The reST syntax for adding the image is

  .. figure:: /images/filename.ext
   :name: fig-label

   Caption text.

[This area should give an introduction to users, but at greater depth than the overview on the higher-level page. Some repetition is fine.
Discussion of high-level control classes (if applicable), primary use cases, links to any useful documentation etc can be included.
Reference to configurations may also be worthwhile]

Barracuda Interface
======================

[This area should link to the XML, then discuss the primary commands/events/telemetry that are expected to be used.
A full explanation of all possible commands/events/telemetry is beyond the scope of this document.
However, the description in the XML should be verified to be adequately populated such that a user can find the deeper information if required.]

Example Use-Case
================

[This area should walk the user through the standard use-case(s) for using the CSC.
This includes any required code, usage of certain commands/events etc.
Multiple code blocks will probably be necessary.]
